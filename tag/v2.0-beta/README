snppsend version 2.00a - THIS IS A BETA RELEASE

--BETA NOTES--
snppsend has been completely rewritten.
The major change is from perl to python.
It's going to be in python now.  Don't ask why.

--WHAT IS SNPPSEND?--
snppsend is an application written in python to send messages to text (alpha-
numeric) pagers.  snppsend reads text from stdin, converts any combination
of CR/LF to a space and then sends the data to the recipients specified
on the command line.

--HELP AND SUPPORT--
snppsend runs perfectly on my various Ubuntu boxes.  Your mileage may vary.

If you experience any problems running snppsend on your machine, feel free to
drop me a message (code@darkpixel.com).

--INSTALL AND SETUP--
Installing snppsend is very easy.
 - Login as root.
 - Copy snppsend to /usr/bin
 - Copy snppsend.ini to /etc
 - Edit /etc/snppsend.ini with your favorite text editor

--ADVANCED USERS--
Anyone familiar with python can dive into the code and play.
