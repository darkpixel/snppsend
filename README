snppsend version 1.5

--WHAT IS SNPPSEND?--
snppsend is an application written in python to send messages to text (alpha-
numeric) pagers.  snppsend reads text from stdin, converts any combination
of CR/LF to a space and then sends the data to the recipients specified
on the command line.

--HELP AND SUPPORT--
snppsend runs perfectly on my various Ubuntu boxes.  Your mileage may vary.
