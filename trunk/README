snppsend version 2.00

--NOTES--
snppsend has been completely rewritten.
The big change is from perl to python.
It's going to be in python now.  Don't ask why.
For anyone that managed to get an early sneak peek, the beta version stupidly used /etc/snppsend/snppsend.ini for it's config.  Does it show that I'm a recovering windows n00btard?  The config file is now /etc/snppsend.conf.

--WHAT IS SNPPSEND?--
snppsend is an application written in python to send messages to text (alpha-
numeric) pagers.  snppsend reads text from stdin, converts any combination
of CR/LF to a space and then sends the data to the recipients specified
on the command line.

--HELP AND SUPPORT--
snppsend runs perfectly on my various Ubuntu boxes.  Your mileage may vary.

If you experience any problems running snppsend on your machine, feel free to
drop me a message (code@darkpixel.com).

--INSTALL AND SETUP--
Installing snppsend is very easy.
 - Login as root.
 - Copy snppsend.py to /usr/bin
 - Copy snppsend.conf to /etc
 - Edit /etc/snppsend.conf with your favorite text editor

--ADVANCED USERS--
Anyone familiar with python can dive into the code and play.
