snppsend version 1.95 - THIS IS A BETA RELEASE
****BETA NOTES****
This beta version only supports loading one config file.
My plan is to have snppsend support loading of multiple xml config files.
This will allow companies to distribute a copy of snppsend to every desktop
with a config file that points to somewhere like http://company/pagerlist.xml

Companies would then be able to update all the clients by editing one file.
Employees could still modify their local config file to add their own entries.


WHAT IS SNPPSEND?
snppsend is an application written in perl to send messages to text (alpha-
numeric) pagers.  snppsend reads text from stdin, converts any combination
of CR/LF to a space and then sends the data to the recipients specified
on the command line.


HELP AND SUPPORT
snppsend runs perfectly on my boxes (Fedora Core, modded ipCop Firewall, and
FreeBSD).
If you experience any problems running snppsend on your machine, feel free to
send a message to code@darkpixel.com describing the problem.
Since this application is free and my time is limited, I can not promise
anyone technical support--but I will make an effort.


INSTALL AND SETUP
Installing snppsend is very easy.
 - Login as root.
 - Copy the snppsend file to /usr/bin.
 - Copy the snppsend.conf file to /etc
 - Edit the snppsend.conf file using your favorite text
     editor.  snppsend.conf contains a few examples.


ADVANCED USERS
Anyone familiar with perl can dive into the code and play.
You will notice two lines in the file "LoadConfigFromFile" and
"LoadConfigFromWeb".
These lines allow you to customize where snppsend loads it's data from.
Straight out of the box, the program will look for /etc/snppsend.conf
The LoadConfigFromWeb function will allow you to put in an address like
http://private.mycompany.com/snppsend.conf.
If you deploy snppsend throughout a company, this will allow you to have
all copies reading the same config file off the internet.  Changes to one
file will affect all versions of snppsend.
