snppsend version 2.00a - THIS IS A BETA RELEASE

--BETA NOTES--
snppsend has been completely rewritten.
The major change is from perl to python.
It's going to be in python now.  Don't ask why.
(Oh--and it was written in vi)

My plan is to have snppsend support loading of multiple xml config files.
This will allow companies to distribute a copy of snppsend to every desktop
with a config file that points to somewhere like http://company/pagerlist.xml

Companies would then be able to update all the clients by editing one file.
Employees could still modify their local config file to add their own entries.



--WHAT IS SNPPSEND?--
snppsend is an application written in python to send messages to text (alpha-
numeric) pagers.  snppsend reads text from stdin, converts and combination
of CR/LF to a space and then sends the data to the recipients specified
on the command line.  (Depending on demand, I may add a flag that leaves
the CR/LF in there--but my text pager doesn't support CRLF).


--HELP AND SUPPORT--
snppsend runs perfectly on my boxes Ubuntu Breezy and Hoary, Fedora Core 3
and 4, and FreeBSD.  Your mileage may vary.

If you experience any problems running snppsend on your machine, feel free to
leave a message in the sourceforge forums, create a bug ticket, or even send
me a message: code@darkpixel.com describing the problem.
Since this application is free and my time is limited, I can not promise
technical support--but I will make an effort.


--INSTALL AND SETUP--
Installing snppsend is very easy.
 - Login as root.
 - Copy snppsend.py to /usr/bin
 - Copy snppsend.xml to /etc
 - Edit snppsend.xml using your favorite text editor.


--ADVANCED USERS--
Anyone familiar with python can dive into the code and play.
